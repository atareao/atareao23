# About atareao23

A theme for atareao.es derived from Blockbase


## Building

atareao23 uses SCSS to compile the CSS used to ponyfill Gutenberg.

In order to compile SCSS to CSS use `grass` a SASS compiler written purely in Rust. To install `grass`, simply,

```bash
cargo install grass
```

Need some `WordPress` sass code to do the complilation. To do this, use `just`.
